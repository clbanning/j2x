j2x.go - Encode arbitrary JSON strings or map[string]interface{} values as XML.

MOTIVATION

As part of our message hub project we want to make XML documents first class members
and had written the x2j package (http://godoc.org/github.com/clbanning/x2j) to parse
and filter XML encoded messages.  This package allows filtered messages to be delivered
as XML docs even if they are published to the hub as JSON encoded messages.

USAGE

The package is fairly well self-documented. (http://godoc.org/github.com/clbanning/j2x)  

XML ENCODING CONVENTIONS

   - JSON and map[string]interface{} keys that are prefixed with a hyphen, '-',
     are treated as attributes.
   - The value for the key '#text' is treated as the value for a simple element.
   - map[string]interface{} member values that are not standard JSON types - numbers,
	  character strings, boolean values, lists and JSON strings - are marshal'd using
	  xml.Marshal.  Thus, values can be complex structures, etc.
