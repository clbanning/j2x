The j2x package terminates empty elements using '/>' rather than '<tag ...></tag>'.  

The MapToDoc() marshals variables of type map[string]interface{} where interface{}(value) can be 
structures or any other Go type that xml.Marshal() can encode.  If you want to have xml.Marshal()
encode empty elements in a manner consist with j2x, then you need to hack the pkg/encoding/xml/marshal.go
file to support that convention.

The marshal.go.hacked file in this repo does that; use it in place of the standard library marshal.go file.

The example_test.go.hacked file extends the package example_test.go file to provide an example of the
SetUseNullEndTag() function as part of the godoc documentation.
